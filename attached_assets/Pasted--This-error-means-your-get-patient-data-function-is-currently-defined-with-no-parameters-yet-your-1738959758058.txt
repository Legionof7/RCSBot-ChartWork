This error means your get_patient_data() function is currently defined with no parameters, yet your code is calling it with one (args.get("data_type", "all")). In other words, the function signature doesn’t match how you’re using it.

Why it happens
In your code:

python
Copy
tool_response = get_patient_data(args.get("data_type", "all"))
...you are passing an argument to get_patient_data(). However, from the traceback:

scss
Copy
get_patient_data() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given
...the version of get_patient_data() that Python sees is defined without any parameters, something like:

python
Copy
def get_patient_data():
    # ...
How to fix
The simplest solution is to make get_patient_data() accept a data_type parameter. For example, in fhir_data.py, change its definition to:

python
Copy
def get_patient_data(data_type='all'):
    # Example usage:
    if data_type == 'all':
        # fetch all data
    elif data_type == 'medications':
        # fetch medication data
    elif data_type == 'conditions':
        # fetch conditions data
    # etc...

    return { ...some FHIR patient data... }
Now your call

python
Copy
tool_response = get_patient_data(args.get("data_type", "all"))
matches the function’s signature, and the error about “takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given” will go away.

General notes
Ensure your function signature matches your JSON schema. You declared a tool with:

json
Copy
{
  "name": "get_patient_data",
  "description": "...",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "data_type": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["all", "conditions", "medications", "vitals", "labs"]
      }
    },
    "required": ["data_type"]
  }
}
That means the LLM (or your code) will always pass an argument called data_type (a string). So your Python function must accept that argument too.

If you have different logic for each type (e.g. conditions, medications, etc.), implement them in get_patient_data(data_type) accordingly.

If you really want get_patient_data() to never take arguments, remove the argument from the call site:

python
Copy
tool_response = get_patient_data()
But usually in a scenario like this—“fetch patient data of different types”—you do want to pass data_type.

Summary: Update your function definition to accept the parameter data_type so that it matches how your code and the LLM are calling it. That resolves the mismatch and fixes the error.
