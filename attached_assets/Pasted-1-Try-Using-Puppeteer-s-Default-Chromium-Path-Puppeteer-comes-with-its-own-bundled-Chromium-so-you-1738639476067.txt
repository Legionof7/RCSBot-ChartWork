1. Try Using Puppeteer's Default Chromium Path
Puppeteer comes with its own bundled Chromium, so you don't need to specify an executablePath manually unless you need a specific version of Chromium. Let's try launching Puppeteer without specifying executablePath:

js
Copy
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox', '--disable-dev-shm-usage'],
  headless: 'new'
});
By doing this, Puppeteer will automatically use the bundled Chromium, which should resolve the issue if Puppeteer is properly installed.

2. Verify Puppeteer's Chromium Installation
Since you're sure Puppeteer is installed, let's check if the bundled Chromium is available by inspecting Puppeteer's executablePath method.

Try the following code to log the path Puppeteer is trying to use:

js
Copy
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  headless: 'new'
});
console.log(await browser.version()); // Log the version of the browser Puppeteer uses
This should show the version of Chromium that Puppeteer is using, and if it doesn't work, it will help diagnose whether Puppeteer is indeed using its own bundled Chromium or trying to access an external one.

3. Install Missing Dependencies
Sometimes, when running Puppeteer in environments like Docker or certain Linux distributions, Chromium might be missing required dependencies that can prevent it from launching. You can install the required dependencies by running:

For Ubuntu-based systems:

bash
Copy
sudo apt-get install -y libx11-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxcomposite-dev libxdamage-dev libxi-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libnss3 libasound2 libnspr4
These libraries are essential for running Chromium in headless mode.

4. Specify Full Path to Chromium Manually
If you want to manually specify the path to Chromium, you can do so by running:

bash
Copy
which chromium
This will give you the correct path to the Chromium binary. Then, modify your Puppeteer launch code:

js
Copy
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  executablePath: '/path/to/chromium',  // Correct path from `which chromium`
  args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox', '--disable-dev-shm-usage'],
  headless: 'new'
});
5. Check for Puppeteer Updates
It's always a good idea to ensure that your version of Puppeteer is up to date. Sometimes, bugs are fixed in newer versions:

bash
Copy
npm update puppeteer-core
This will ensure you're using the latest stable version of Puppeteer.

Conclusion
If the issue persists after trying the above steps, it could be related to the environment or configuration. Let me know if you still face the issue after these steps, and we can dive deeper into it!
