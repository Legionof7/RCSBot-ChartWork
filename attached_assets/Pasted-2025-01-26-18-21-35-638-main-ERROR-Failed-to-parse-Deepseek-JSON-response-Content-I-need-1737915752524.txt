2025-01-26 18:21:35,638 - __main__ - ERROR - Failed to parse Deepseek JSON response. Content: I need to process the user's message and the provided patient data to generate an appropriate response. The user just said, "Hi," which seems like a greeting, so I should return a friendly and welcoming reply.

Looking at the patient data, I see relevant information about his conditions, medications, lab results, and care plan. I should highlight key points addressed in the care plan, such as blood pressure control, blood sugar monitoring, and cholesterol management.

I'll structure the response to mention the greetings, acknowledge the active conditions, and then provide insights based on the data. Including a graph would help visualize the lab results, making it easier to understand. I'll include buttons and quick replies for easy navigation.

Now, structuring the JSON response with the text, cards, graph data, and buttons. I need to replace {GRAPH_URL_0} with an actual URL if I had one or note that it's a placeholder if not. The buttons and quick replies should prompt the user to look into diet or exercise.

Finally, ensuring the response is concise, helpful, and formatted correctly according to the provided structure.
