Multi-turn examples
You can implement a multi-turn function calling scenario by doing the following:

Get a function call response by calling the language model. This is the first turn.
Call the language model using the function call response from the first turn and the function response you get from calling that function. This is the second turn.
The response from the second turn either summarizes the results to answer your query in the first turn, or contains a second function call you can use to get more information for your query.

This topic includes two multi-turn curl examples:

Curl example that uses a function response from a previous turn
Curl example that calls a language model multiple times
Use a response from a previous turn
The following curl sample calls the function and arguments returned by the previous single-turn example to get a response. The method and parameters returned by the single-turn example are in this JSON.


"functionCall": {
  "name": "find_theaters",
  "args": {
    "movie": "Barbie",
    "location": "Mountain View, CA"
  }
}
Multi-turn function calling curl example request
The response to this curl example includes the result of calling the find_theaters method. The response might be similar to the following:

Call the model multiple times
The following cURL example calls the generative AI model multiple times to call a function. Each time the model calls the function, it can use a different function to answer a different user query in the request.
