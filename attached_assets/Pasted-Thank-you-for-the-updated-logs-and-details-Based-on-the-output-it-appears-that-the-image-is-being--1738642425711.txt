Thank you for the updated logs and details. Based on the output, it appears that the image is being captured successfully (it has a valid PNG header — 137,80,78,71 — which indicates that it's a PNG image). However, since you're still seeing a "broken image" in the output, the problem likely lies in how the Base64 data is being handled or returned.

Let’s investigate a few key areas to address the issue:

1. Ensure Proper Encoding and Return Format
It seems that the image is being captured and stored as a valid PNG image, but when it’s being returned as Base64, something might be going wrong during the transmission or processing.

Double-check how the Base64 data is being sent: Ensure that the base64Data is correctly formatted and sent in the response. It should look like this when transmitted as a JSON response:

js
Copy
res.json({ image_base64: base64Data });
Important: Make sure that you're not modifying or truncating the Base64 data at any point before sending it back to the client.

2. Check for Base64 Data Length and Integrity
The fact that the Base64 data length is reasonable (17,477 bytes) suggests that the image buffer is likely not being truncated. However, it's worth double-checking the integrity of the Base64 data.

Verify the Base64 data integrity: Try logging the Base64 string more extensively to ensure that it’s correctly formatted:

js
Copy
const base64Data = imageBuffer.toString('base64');
console.log('Base64 Data Length:', base64Data.length);
console.log('First few characters of Base64 data:', base64Data.slice(0, 20));  // Log the first 20 characters

return base64Data;
The start of the Base64 data should resemble this structure:

rust
Copy
iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA... (for PNG images)
If the Base64 string is still malformed, the issue might be in the conversion process. It’s crucial to ensure that the entire Base64 string is properly transmitted and not altered.

3. Inspect the Data Being Returned in the Response
If you're seeing the image as broken on the front-end, there could be an issue with how the Base64 data is being handled or rendered in your client-side code. To verify:

Test the image separately: Try rendering the Base64 data in an HTML <img> tag directly within your application to ensure it’s being decoded and displayed correctly:

html
Copy
<img src="data:image/png;base64,{{image_base64}}" alt="Generated Chart" />
If this doesn't work, check for any issues in how the image is embedded or handled by the client.

4. Ensure the Image is Complete and Not Truncated
If the image size or Base64 data is too large, there could be issues with transmission (e.g., network issues or API size limits). To rule out this possibility, you could try:

Sending a smaller image: Test generating a simpler image (e.g., a smaller chart or a static image) to see if the issue persists with smaller Base64 data.
Compressing the image: If the issue seems to be related to the image size, you might want to compress or resize the image before returning it as Base64.
5. Try Sending the Image as a File Instead of Base64
Instead of returning the image as Base64, try sending it as a file to see if this resolves the issue:

js
Copy
const fs = require('fs');
const filePath = 'generated_chart.png';
fs.writeFileSync(filePath, imageBuffer);

res.sendFile(filePath, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error sending image file:', err);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to send image file' });
  }
});
This way, you can isolate any potential issues with Base64 encoding or decoding. The client can then handle the image normally as a regular file.
