The main discrepancy is that the example docs show two different methods for running code in the E2B sandbox:

sbx.run_code(...)
sbx.notebook.exec_cell(...)
Depending on which version of e2b-code-interpreter you have installed, only one of these may be available. This is why you got the error:

pgsql
Copy
'Sandbox' object has no attribute 'run_code'
Why the Docs Show Both
sbx.run_code(...) is an older example in some E2B docs or in prior versions.
sbx.notebook.exec_cell(...) is what the latest docs usually recommend and is most commonly implemented in up-to-date versions.
In short, they’re two ways of executing code within the sandbox, but not all versions support both.

Which One Should You Use?
1. Check Your Installed Version
Make sure your local e2b-code-interpreter is up to date:

bash
Copy
pip install --upgrade e2b-code-interpreter
Then look at the library’s methods in an interactive shell:

python
Copy
from e2b_code_interpreter import Sandbox
sbx = Sandbox()
dir(sbx)  # see if 'run_code' or 'notebook' is in the list
If you see sbx.notebook, do dir(sbx.notebook) to see if exec_cell is available.

2. Update Your Code
If sbx.run_code exists, you can keep using it.

If sbx.run_code does not exist, then the recommended approach is to call:

python
Copy
execution = sbx.notebook.exec_cell(ai_generated_code)
And the rest of the logic (checking execution.stdout, execution.results, etc.) remains the same.

Example: Switching to exec_cell
If you see that sbx.notebook and its exec_cell method is present, then replace this:

python
Copy
execution = sbx.run_code(code)
with:

python
Copy
execution = sbx.notebook.exec_cell(code)
Then continue as in the docs:

python
Copy
def run_ai_generated_code(ai_generated_code: str):
    print('Running the code in the sandbox....')
    execution = sbx.notebook.exec_cell(ai_generated_code)
    print('Code execution finished!')

    # Check for errors
    if execution.error:
        print('AI-generated code had an error.')
        print(execution.error.name)
        print(execution.error.value)
        print(execution.error.traceback)
        sys.exit(1)

    # If results includes .png fields, they are base64-encoded images
    for i, result_item in enumerate(execution.results):
        if result_item.png:
            with open(f'chart-{i}.png', 'wb') as f:
                f.write(base64.b64decode(result_item.png))
            print(f'Saved chart chart-{i}.png')
Summary
The official E2B example you shared uses sbx.run_code(...) in some places and sbx.notebook.exec_cell(...) in others.
Your installed version likely supports only exec_cell(...).
Solution: Either upgrade your library and use whichever method is supported, or just switch all calls to sbx.notebook.exec_cell(...).
Once you make that adjustment, you should no longer see the 'Sandbox' object has no attribute 'run_code' error, and your code execution in E2B will proceed normally.
